## Introduction
Welcome to the Food Delivery App, a modern and intuitive web application built using React. This application provides a seamless food ordering experience, allowing users to browse restaurants, view menus, and place orders directly from their browser.

## Challenge Elements

### User Story
- As a user, I want to be able to securely log in and register so that I can manage my orders and have a personalized experience.
- As a user, I want to browse through a list of restaurants to find those that offer the food I'm craving.
- As a user, I want to view a restaurantâ€™s menu to see available food items and their prices.
- As a user, I want to add items to my cart and place an order so that I can receive my food.
- As a user, I want to securely pay for my order so that I can complete my purchase confidently.
- As a user, I want the application to work well on both desktop and mobile devices so that I can access it from any device.

### Acceptance Criteria
- Users must be able to register with a unique email, password. They should be able to log in with their credentials and be redirected to the home page upon successful login, or see an error message for incorrect credentials. Logout functionality should be available, redirecting users to the login page upon success.
- The application should display a list of restaurants with names, images and allow users to choose their restaurant.
- The menu should display food items with descriptions, prices, and images if available and users should be able to add items to their cart.
- Users should be able to view, update, and remove items in their cart, with the total price and applicable taxes displayed. During checkout, users should review their order, enter delivery information, and select a payment method.
- The checkout page must integrate with a secure payment provider like Stripe, allowing users to enter payment details and complete the transaction securely. A payment confirmation and order receipt should be provided upon successful payment.
- The application should be fully functional and visually appealing on various screen sizes, with mobile responsiveness ensuring easy navigation and interaction. On desktop devices, the application should make full use of available screen space.
